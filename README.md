# Unity-Wing-It-Game
Upper 6th Coursework Unity Video Game, A Flappy Bird Spin-Off with a Twist :) (Finished)

For sixth form i opted to create a video game for my coursework, and took my inspiration from flappy bird,
however instead of having a countinuous level I would include levels of different difficulties.

Game Comprises of:
- Home Menu, End Game Menu,
- Normal & Hard Mode

Most of the assets were sourced online, the code for my projects is availaible to view within this repository
